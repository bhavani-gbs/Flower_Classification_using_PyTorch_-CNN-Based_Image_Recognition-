# Flower Classification using PyTorch

A deep learning image classification project that identifies flower species using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) implemented in PyTorch.

The model is trained on a multi-class flower dataset and learns to classify images into different flower categories with high accuracy.

## Project Overview

Image classification is a fundamental computer vision task.

This project:

* Loads and preprocesses flower image datasets
* Applies data augmentation techniques
* Uses a CNN-based architecture for classification
* Trains the model using PyTorch
* Evaluates performance using accuracy metrics

The system demonstrates how deep learning can effectively classify visual patterns in real-world datasets.

## Model Architecture

The model consists of:
* Convolutional Layers (Feature Extraction)
* ReLU Activation
* Max Pooling
* Fully Connected Layers
* Softmax Output Layer
The CNN automatically learns spatial features such as edges, textures, and patterns from flower images.
